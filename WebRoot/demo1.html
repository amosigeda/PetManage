	<h3 id="f1">1. Introduction</h3>
	<p>We, the team from Paby, are pleased to see you being interested
		in our products and we are confident that our apps and the Paby
		products match to you perfectly. To use our products, we have to
		clarify certain things with you. For example, what rights and
		responsibilities we have towards you and which ones you have towards
		us, how long various periods last and many more details. One of them
		is a privacy policy.</p>

	<h3 id="f2">2. Privacy Policy</h3>
	<h4>2.1. Introduction</h4>
	<p>Paby Inc. ("we," "us," "our," or "Company") knows that you care
		about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take
		your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about
		how we use your personal information. By visiting, accessing or using
		the www.paby.com website and domain name, and any other linked pages,
		features, content, one or more Paby Inc. devices (the "Product"), or
		application services (including, without limitation, mobile
		applications) offered from time to time by Company in connection
		therewith (collectively, the "Website"), or using any of our Services,
		you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in
		this Privacy Policy. Unless specifically defined, terms used
		throughout this Privacy Policy (this "Privacy Policy") have the same
		definitions as those given in the Company Terms of Use, available at
		http://www.paby.com/terms-of-use/ (the "Terms of Use"), of which this
		Privacy Policy forms a part.</p>
	<h4>2.2. Scope</h4>
	<p>By visiting and/or using our websites and participating in any
		of our programs or service offerings, you agree to this Privacy
		Policy. Our Privacy Policy applies to both our online and offline
		customers. This policy also applies to both our existing and former
		customers. In addition, this policy applies to each individual who
		visits our Sites or otherwise provides us with Personal Information,
		even if such individual does not buy our products or services.</p>
	<h4>2.3. Information Collected</h4>
	<p>2.3.1. The information we gather from customers enables us to
		personalize and improve our Services, and allows our users to set up a
		user account, pet profile and personal profile that can be used to
		personalize their experience on the Website and the Application. We
		collect the following types of information from our customers.</p>
	<p>2.3.2. Your username, password and e-mail address when you
		register for a Paby account.</p>
	<p>2.3.3. Profile information that you provide for your user
		profile and pet profile (e.g., first and last name, picture, birth
		date, physical attributes of yourself and the pet, location, phone
		number).</p>
	<p>2.3.4. User Content (e.g., photos, comments, and other
		materials) that you post to the Service.</p>
	<p>2.3.5. Communications between you and Paby. For example, we may
		send you Service-related emails (e.g., account verification,
		changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security
		notices). Note that you may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.</p>
	<p>2.3.6. Device Identifiers: When you use a mobile device like a
		tablet or phone to access our Service, we may access, collect,
		monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more
		"device identifiers." Device identifiers are small data files or
		similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile
		device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device
		identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware,
		data stored in connection with the device's operating system or other
		software, or data sent to the device by Paby.</p>
	<p>2.3.7. A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a
		third party partner about how you browse and use the Service and may
		help us or others provide reports or personalized content and ads.
		Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or
		availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.</p>
	<p>2.3.8. Metadata: Metadata is usually technical data that is
		associated with User Content. For example, Metadata can describe how,
		when and by whom a piece of User Content was collected and how that
		content is formatted.</p>
	<p>2.3.9. Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User
		Content including a hashtag (e.g., to mark keywords when you post a
		photo), geotag (e.g., to mark your location to a photo), comments or
		other data. This makes your User Content more searchable by others and
		more interactive. If you geotag your photo or tag your photo using
		other's APIs then, your latitude and longitude will be stored with the
		photo and searchable (e.g., through a location or map feature) if your
		photo is made public by you in accordance with your privacy settings.</p>
	<p>2.3.10. Personal information you provide to us: We receive and
		store any information you enter on our Website and application or
		provide to us in any other way, including, without limitation, through
		use of the Product. The types of personal information ("Personal
		Information") collected in this fashion may include, but is not
		necessarily limited to, your (and your pet's) name and/or location,
		your email address, IP address, browser and/or device information,
		username, password, your pet's activity data, your pet's activity
		goals, any content you post to your profile or through the Website and
		application, and any other information necessary for us to provide our
		Services. You can choose not to provide us with certain information,
		but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special
		features. The Personal Information you provide is used for such
		purposes as answering questions, improving the content and community
		experience of the Website, customizing the advertising and content you
		and other users and prospective users see, and communicating with you
		about Company's products and services, including specials and new
		features.</p>
	<p>2.3.11. Personal information collected automatically: We receive
		and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our
		Website or use our Services. Company automatically receives and
		records information on our server logs from your browser including
		your IP address, cookie information, browser and/or mobile device
		information, operating system, timestamps, the pages you request, and
		the actions and path you take on the Website.</p>
	<p>2.3.12. Generally, our Services automatically collect usage
		information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our
		Website and how those users use its various components, including,
		without limitation, pet activity data from the Product. We also use
		third party tracking-utility partners to gather information, including
		Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service
		provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time
		stamp and click-stream data. Except to allow you to use the features
		and functionalities of the Product, Website, Services and — if you opt
		to receive them— certain partners' and/or affiliates' products and
		services, we only use this data in aggregate form, that is, as a
		statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you or
		your pet personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure
		out how customers use parts of the Website or Services so that we can
		make the Website appealing to as many customers as possible, and
		improve those Services. As part of this use of information, we may
		provide aggregate information to our partners about how our customers,
		collectively, use our Website or Services. We share this type of
		statistical data so that our partners also understand how people use
		the Website or Services, so that they, too, may provide you with an
		optimal experience. Company never discloses aggregate information to a
		partner in a manner that would identify you or your pet personally,
		except as may be required to provide you with features and
		functionalities selected by you and provided through the products and
		Services of our integration partners.</p>
	<p>2.3.13."Non-Personally Identifiable Information" does NOT
		identify you personally. For example, we may conduct research on our
		users' demographics, interests, and behavior based on the information
		provided to us from various sources such as our server log files,
		surveys, cookies and other technologies. We do this to better
		understand and serve you. This research is compiled and analyzed on an
		aggregated basis. You may set most browsers to notify you if you
		receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your
		browser. However, our site(s) do not currently respond to "Do Not
		Track" signals (DNT). We are continuing to monitor DNT developments
		and may revisit the issue in the future. In the meantime, you can
		exercise other choices available to you, including limiting the
		placement of cookies on your device using your browser's cookie
		control features and other choices described in this privacy policy.
		Note that if your settings block cookies and tracking, you may not be
		able to take advantage of the personalized features enjoyed by other
		users of our Sites.</p>
	<p>2.3.14.We also may collect non-personally identifiable
		information from you in order to customize your experience, fulfill
		your requests for information, and improve our services. We may
		provide this non-personally identifiable information to third parties.
		For example, we might inform third parties about the number of users
		of our Sites and the activities they conduct while on the Sites. We
		also may provide trusted partners with general information regarding
		our users and visitors.</p>
	<p>
		2.3.15.We utilize Google Analytics features, including demographics
		and interests reporting, display network impression reporting,
		remarketing, and DoubleClick campaign manager integration to help
		facilitate the delivery of relevant content, to identify how users
		engage with our Sites, and to provide us with information regarding
		our users. Google provides a complete privacy policy and instructions
		on opting out of Google Analytics here: <a
			href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html."
			class="website">http://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html.</a>
	</p>
	<p>2.3.16. We track Site usage information through the use of
		cookies for analytic and internal purposes only, your selection of the
		"do not track" option, or analogous option, provided by your browser
		may not have any effect on our collection of cookie information for
		these purposes. The only way to completely "opt out" of the collection
		of any information through cookies or other tracking technology is to
		actively manage the settings on your browser or mobile device to
		delete and disable cookies and other tracking/recording tools. (To
		learn more about cookies, clear gifs/web beacons and related
		technologies, you may wish to visit allaboutcookies.org). We permit
		third party advertising partners to use cookies and other technology
		to collect information about your browsing activities over time and
		across different websites when you use our Site. For example, we use
		advertising services provided by third party ad partners, such as
		[Google Display Network] and [AdRoll], to market our services to you
		on other websites. Through a process called "retargeting," each
		service places a cookie on your browser when you visit our Site so
		that they can identify you and serve you ads on other sites around the
		web based on your browsing activity. To avoid tracking by these third
		party ad partners, you can change your browser settings to reject
		cookies or to notify you when cookies are set and you could select the
		"do not track" option on your browser, though we have no control over
		and cannot confirm whether these third party ad parties honor the "do
		not track" browser signal.</p>
	<p>2.3.17. We would like to point out that we use the social
		network Facebook's website custom audiences in the context of usage
		based online advertisement. The custom audience pixel provides
		information about the way visitors use our website. The collected
		information about the website user can be associated with information
		about the related Facebook user. We can use the information in this
		way for displaying interest-based advertising. In the course of the
		hashing process personal data are converted into checksums. This makes
		it impossible to track the identity of a Facebook user. The
		information mentioned above will be stored for 60 days. Further
		information about website custom audiences and the possibility to
		revoke data collection can be found at
		https://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=ads.</p>
	<p>2.3.18. We would like to point out that we use Twitter's
		Conversion Tracking and Tailored Audiences in the context of Twitter
		Advertising. Those products are offered through Twitter Inc., 1355
		Market Street, Suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA. User data will
		be collected through our website in order to set up advertisement
		concerning the user's interests as well as for conversion tracking.
		Further information about Twitter Advertising and information about
		how you can prevent Tailored Audiences can be found at
		https://support.twitter.com.</p>
	<p>2.3.19. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION: In addition to some of the
		specific uses of information we describe in this Privacy Policy, we
		may use information that we receive to:</p>
	<p>2.3.19.1. Help you efficiently access your information after you

	<p>2.3.19.2. Remember information so you will not have to re-enter

		of our Service</p>
	<p>2.3.19.5. Develop and test new products and features</p>

	<p>2.3.19.9. Paby or other Users may run contests, special offers
		or other events or activities ("Events") on the Service. If you do not

		means to do so. For example, if you've given us your email address, we
		may send you promotional email offers on behalf of other businesses,
		or email you about your use of the Website. We may receive a
		confirmation when you open an email from Company if your computer or
		device supports this type of functionality. Company uses this
		confirmation to help us make emails more interesting and helpful and
		to improve the Website and our Services. We also compare our customer
		list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid
		sending unnecessary messages to our customers. When you receive e-mail
		from Company, you can opt out of receiving further e-mails by

	<h4>2.6. 3rd Party Websites & Advertises</h4>
	<p>2.6.1. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information
		collected by Paby Inc. The Sites may contain links to other web sites.
		We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of
		these other web sites. While you are visiting or using our Sites or
		services, you may be presented with an opportunity to purchase third
		party products or services. These products and services are offered
		and supplied by independent companies not owned or operated by Paby
		Inc.. If you click on one of the presented offers, you will be
		redirected to the web site of the third party, and any information you
		provide in response to the offer will be collected and used by the
		third party and not by Paby Inc. Information you provide to the third
		party and any dealings you have with third parties will be governed by
		the privacy and other policies of that third party.</p>
	<p>2.6.2. Additionally, we may use advertisers, third party ad
		networks, and other advertising companies to serve advertisements on
		the Sites. Please be advised that such advertising companies may
		gather information about your visit to our Sites or other sites (such
		as through cookies, web beacons and other technologies) to enable such
		advertising companies to market products or services to you, to
		monitor which ads have been served to your browser and which web pages
		you were viewing when such ads were delivered. If you would like more
		information about this practice and to know your choices please click
		here. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS POLICY DOES NOT COVER THE COLLECTION AND
		USE OF INFORMATION BY SUCH ADVERTISING COMPANIES AND OTHER THIRD
		PARTIES.</p>
	<h4>2.7. Cookies</h4>
	<p>2.7.1. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to
		your computer's (or other device's) persistent storage medium (e.g.,
		hard drive) through your browser to enable our systems to recognize
		your browser and tell us how and when pages on our Website are visited
		and by how many people. We use cookies to enhance visitors'
		experiences, to learn more about their use of the Website and to
		improve quality. Company cookies do not collect Personal Information,
		but we may combine the general information collected through cookies
		with Personal Information to tell us who you are or what your screen
		name or email address is.</p>
	<p>2.7.2. Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie
		feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies,
		as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software)
		allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety
		of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated,
		however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of our
		Website's most attractive features.</p>
	<p>2.7.3. Ads appearing on the Website may be delivered to users by
		our advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the
		ad server to recognize your computer or other device each time they
		send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or
		others who use your computer or device. This information allows ad
		networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that
		they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy
		covers the use of cookies by Company and does not cover the use of
		cookies by any advertisers.</p>
	<h4>2.8. Sharing of personal information</h4>
	<p>2.8.1. Personal Information about our customers is an integral
		part of our business. We neither rent nor sell your Personal
		Information to anyone. We share your Personal Information only as
		described below.</p>
	<p>2.8.2. Advertisers: As discussed above, we allow advertisers to
		choose the demographic information of users who will see their
		advertisements and you agree that we may use any of the information we
		have collected from you (including, without limitation, information
		you may have decided not to show to other users) to select or allow
		the advertiser to select the appropriate audience for those
		advertisements. For example, we may allow an advertiser to target an
		ad to you based on your query history. We may deliver a file to you
		through the Website (known as a "web beacon") from an ad network. Web
		beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing,
		research and reporting for us and for advertisers. Web beacons also
		enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you
		visit other websites. Because your web browser must request these
		advertisements and web beacons from the ad network's servers, these
		companies can view, edit, or set their own cookies, just as if you had
		requested a web page from their site.</p>
	<p>2.8.3. Third Party Associated businesses we do not control: We
		anticipate that we may become associated with a variety of third party
		businesses and work closely with them. In certain situations, these
		businesses may sell items to you through the Website. In other
		situations, Company may provide services, or sell products jointly
		with associated businesses. You can recognize when an associated
		business is associated with your transaction, and we will share your
		Personal Information that is related to such transactions with that
		associated business.</p>
	<p>2.8.4. Third Party Agents: We employ other third party companies
		and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your
		information with them to provide products or services (including the
		Product and Service) to you and to otherwise enhance the user or
		prospective user experience. Unless we tell you differently, Company's
		agents do not have any right to use Personal Information we share with
		them beyond what is necessary to assist us. You hereby consent to our
		sharing of Personal Information for the above purposes.</p>
	<p>2.8.5. User profiles and submissions: Certain user profile
		information and data about your use of the Website, Product and/or
		Service, including without limitation, your name, your pet's name (and
		breed, gender, and other information you have provided), activity
		goals, other users with whom you're connected, your location, and any
		video or image or other data and content that has been uploaded to the
		Website, may be displayed to other users to facilitate user
		interaction within the Website or address your request for our
		Services. Some such data and information (including without
		limitation, your first name, your pet's name and profile information,
		activity goals and milestones (e.g. streaks), "friends" and their
		pets, activity comparisons with your friends, and uploaded posts and
		content) may be displayed publicly to other users of the Website by
		default; your account privacy settings allow you to control whether
		your account appears publicly in searches by other users. Please
		remember that any content you upload to your public user profile, or
		do not specify as non-public through the functionality of the Website,
		along with any Personal Information or content that you voluntarily
		disclose online in a manner other users can view (in social media
		posts, on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, etc.) becomes
		publicly available, and can be collected and used by others. Your user
		name and any other information you choose to include may also be
		displayed to other users if and when you send messages or comments or
		upload images or videos through the Website and other users can
		contact you through messages and comments. Additionally, if you sign
		into the Website through a third party social networking site or
		service, your list of "friends" from that site or service may be
		automatically imported to the Website, and such "friends," if they are
		also registered users of the Website, may be able to access certain
		non-public information you have entered in your Website user profile.
		Again, we do not control the policies and practices of any other third
		party site or service.</p>
	<p>2.8.6. Business transfers: In some cases, we may choose to buy,
		sell or license assets. In these types of transactions, customer
		information is typically one of the business assets that are
		transferred. Moreover, if Company, or substantially all of its assets
		were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Company goes out of
		business or enters bankruptcy, customer information would be one of
		the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You
		acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of
		Company or its assets may continue to use your Personal Information as
		set forth in this policy.</p>
	<p>2.8.7. Protection of Company and others: We may release Personal
		Information when we believe in good faith that such release is
		necessary to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Terms of Use
		available at http://www.Paby.com/terms-of-use/ and other agreements;
		or protect the rights, property, or safety of Company, our employees,
		our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other
		companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk
		reduction.</p>
	<p>2.8.8. With your consent: Except as set forth above, you will be
		notified via email when your Personal Information may be shared with
		third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this
		information.</p>
	<h4>2.9. Information You can Access</h4>
	<p>2.9.1. Company allows you to access the following information
		about you for the purpose of viewing, and in certain situations,
		updating or deleting that information. This list will change as the
		Website changes.</p>
	<p>2.9.2. Real name (and pet's and veterinarian's name)</p>
	<p>2.9.3. Account and user profile information (including pet's
		profile information), including images and other data and information
		you have uploaded to the Website</p>
	<p>2.9.4. User e-mail address</p>
	<p>2.9.5. Location</p>
	<p>2.9.6. Username and password</p>
	<p>2.9.7. User preferences</p>
	<h4>2.10.Security of personal information</h4>
	<p>2.10.1. No data transmissions over the Internet can be
		guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, we cannot ensure or
		warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you
		understand that any information that you transfer to Paby Inc. is done
		at your own risk.</p>
	<p>2.10.2. Once we receive your transmission, we make reasonable
		efforts to ensure security on our systems. We use firewalls to protect
		your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or
		destruction. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that
		such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed
		by breach of such firewalls and secure server software.</p>
	<p>2.10.3. If we learn of a security systems breach we may attempt
		to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate
		protective steps. By using these Sites or providing Personal
		Information to us you agree that we can communicate with you
		electronically regarding security, privacy and administrative issues
		relating to your use of these Sites. We may post a notice on our Sites
		if a security breach occurs. We may also send an email to you at the
		email address you have provided to us in these circumstances.
		Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive
		notice of a security breach in writing.</p>
	<h4>2.11.Changes to Privacy Policy</h4>
	<p>2.11.1. We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy from
		time to time. When we do, we will also revise the "last updated" date
		at the bottom of this page. For changes to this Privacy Policy that
		may be materially less restrictive on our use or disclosure of

	<h4>4.2. GPS Device Disclosures</h4>
	<p>4.2.1. Introduction</p>
	<p>4.2.1.1.Paby Inc. has been developed specifically for pets and
		should only be used to track pets and animals. Some countries, states
		or regions have laws related to location based tracking of people,
		animals and objects. It's the sole responsibility of the owner and
		user to abide by the law and rules in the area the Paby Inc. GPS
		device is used.</p>
	<p>4.2.2. The Service</p>
	<p>4.2.2.1.How the Service Works: Since this is a wireless service,
		the quality of your signal and your ability to get the service may be
		affected by your location. We can't provide service when your Product
		isn't in range of a transmission site used to provide the service. You
		must be within our coverage area to use the service and to perform
		certain functions from your Product, such as initial activation of the
		service, deactivation, and service changes (to name a few). Even
		within our coverage area, there are many factors, including network
		capacity, limitations and restrictions of wireless carrier service
		providers, your Product type, terrain, your proximity to buildings,
		foliage and weather (to name a few) that may impact availability and
		quality of the service. You acknowledge and accept these limitations
		of the service. The service provides an approximate location of the
		requested Product and does not provide guaranteed results. The results
		you obtain from the service, including but not limited to directions,
		maps, and requested locations or messaging, may not be accurate,
		timely or reliable. We reserve the right to set limits on the use of
		the service at our discretion. We do not guarantee that any lost
		animal will be found and we do not provide any service for the purpose
		of searching and/or recovering your animal. THE PABY GPS PRODUCTS ARE
		ONLY INTENDED FOR TRACKING PETS. DO NOT USE FOR TRACKING CHILDREN,
		OTHER HUMANS OR OBJECTS. USING THE PABY GPS PRODUCTS IN A MANNER OTHER
		THAN SPECIFIED IN THE USER MANUAL MAY CAUSE INJURY.</p>
	<p>4.2.2.2.Interrupted Service: The service may be interrupted or
		restricted without notice to you. We are not required to give any
		refunds or credits if your service is interrupted or if your ability
		to use the service is limited based on our network's coverage and
		availability. Please visit http://www.Paby.com/support or contact our
		Customer Experience Center if you have any questions regarding
		interruption of your service.</p>
	<p>4.2.2.3.Your Account: You must establish an account to use the
		service and activate your Product(s). You are responsible for
		maintaining the confidentiality of your account password. You are also
		responsible for all activities that occur in connection with your
		account. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of
		your account. In creating an account, you may not impersonate someone
		else, create an account for anyone other than yourself, provide an
		email address other than your own, or create multiple accounts.</p>
	<p>4.2.2.4.SMS Charges: The service may allow you to send and
		receive text messages (SMS) on your mobile device. The number of
		messages per month will depend upon your settings. You grant us
		authorization to send SMS to your account. Message and data rates may
		apply and you will be responsible for paying such charges. Check with
		your carrier if you have questions about your plan and costs. To stop
		receiving text messages from this service, update your notification
		settings in your mobile app.</p>

		or text messages to mobile, cellular, wireless or similar devices and

		and/or artificial voices or prerecorded messages, even if you incur
		charges for receiving such communications.</p>

		agree that we and our affiliates, agents and independent contractors

		practices and procedures, which we can change without giving notice to
		you. UNLESS OTHERWISE PROHIBITED BY LAW, WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO ADD
		TO, UPDATE OR AMEND THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS</p>
	<p>4.2.3.3.CONTRACT AT ANY TIME. Such updates or amendments will be

	<p>4.2.3.4.Service Plans: When you sign up for the service and

		that generally sets out your subscription information and service
		features, including (to name a few allowances and features) the term,
		duration, billing information, payment due dates, price, costs, fees,
		taxes and recurring charges associated with those allowances and
		features. WE WILL REFER TO YOUR SUBSCRIPTION PACKAGE AND RELATED TERMS
		AS YOUR "PLAN". YOUR PLAN WILL BECOME PART OF THIS CONTRACT. If a term
		or condition of your Plan expressly conflicts with this Contract, the
		term or condition in your Plan will govern. If at any time you change
		your service (for example, by accepting a promotional opportunity
		offered by Paby or subscribing to a new service offering), you will be
		subject to the requirements, such as a new minimum term, associated
		with that change. Cancellation of your subscription before the
		expiration of the applicable term may result in a termination fee as
		detailed in this Contract and/or your Plan. Any service‐included offer
		cannot be combined with any other offers and Paby reserves the right
		to cancel or modify the offer(s) at any time.</p>
	<p>4.2.4. Your rights to end your service or contract</p>
	<p>4.2.4.1.Your Rights to Change or End Your Service; Automatic
		Renewals:</p>
	<p>4.2.4.2.Your account will automatically be charged at the rates
		in effect at the time of renewal. You have the right to change your
		subscription package and Plan. How the change will affect your charges
		will depend on the choices you make. AN EARLY TERMINATION FEE MAY ALSO
		APPLY IF YOU CHOOSE TO END YOUR SERVICE BEFORE YOUR FIRST RENEWAL OR
		ANY SUBSEQUENT RENEWAL, OR IF WE TERMINATE IT EARLY FOR GOOD CAUSE.
		Otherwise, and except as otherwise provided in the next sentence, all
		terminations of Plans based on a monthly, annual or other billing
		cycle by you during such cycle become effective on the last day of
		that billing cycle. You will remain responsible for all fees and
		charges incurred until then and you will not be entitled to any
		partial–month credits or refunds. KEEP IN MIND, HOWEVER, THAT
		SUBSCRIPTIONS AND FEES FOR ALL PRE‐PAID, MONTHLY, ANNUAL AND SIMILAR
		SUBSCRIPTIONS, AND CERTAIN PROMOTIONAL SUBSCRIPTIONS ARE
		NONREFUNDABLE. IN THE EVENT THAT WE ABANDON OR CEASE DISTRIBUTION OF
		THE SERVICE, WHETHER AS A RESULT OF LIQUIDATION, BANKRUPTCY, OR
		OTHERWISE, ALL PREPAID SUBSCRIPTIONS WILL BE TREATED AS NONREFUNDABLE.
		Except as may be permitted by additional terms, each subscription to
		the service is tied to one Product. You may have multiple Products and
		multiple subscriptions. If you add additional Products to your
		account, you must purchase a separate subscription for each one.
		Because a subscription is tied to a Product, if your Product is lost
		or stolen, you must cancel or suspend your subscription or you will
		remain responsible for the payment of the subscription.</p>
	<p>4.2.5. Our rights to Limit to End Your Service</p>
	<p>4.2.5.1.You can only use the service for personal, noncommercial
		uses. You agree not to resell or redistribute the service to someone

		not install, deploy or use any regeneration equipment or similar
		mechanism (for example, a repeater) to originate, amplify, enhance,
		retransmit, copy or regenerate a transmitted radio frequency
		signal(s). WE CAN, WITHOUT NOTICE, LIMIT, SUSPEND OR END YOUR SERVICE
		OR ANY CONTRACT WITH YOU FOR</p>
	<p>4.2.5.1.1.GOOD CAUSE, including, but not limited to: (i) if you:

		affects us, our network or other customers, partners, representatives,
		agents or affiliates. We can also temporarily limit your service for

		COLLECTION AGENCY FEES AND COSTS INCURRED IN COLLECTING</p>
	<p>4.2.6.3.FROM YOU AS PERMITTED BY RELEVANT LAW. You acknowledge
		that any collection fee is not an interest charge, finance charge, or

		an Early Termination Fee for any termination during any Renewal Period
		though there may be administrative or other fees that apply.

		information.</p>
	<p>4.2.7.2.Bill Disputes: You can dispute your account history or
		bill by contacting our Customer Experience Center. Unless otherwise
		provided by law, you must still pay any disputed charges until the
		dispute is resolved.</p>
	<p>4.2.7.3.Payments: All payments must be made in U.S. Dollars.
		Payment is due in full each payment period. As a condition of your
		Plan, you may be obligated to pay in advance by credit card or debit
		card. All amounts due must be paid by the due date to avoid any late
		fees and possible deactivation of the service. We may, at our
		discretion, accept partial payments, which will be applied to the
		oldest outstanding charges on your account. If you are late in making
		any payments to us, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate your
		service, deactivate your Product immediately and report any late
		payment or non‐payment to credit reporting agencies.</p>
	<p>4.2.8. Your product and safety</p>
	<p>4.2.8.1.Your Product: Your product is any Paby GPS pet
		location‐enabled products and related components ("Product") you use
		to receive the service. Whether you buy your Product from Paby or
		someone else is entirely your choice. Paby may change the software
		required for your Product, applications or programming remotely and
		without notice. This could affect the way you use your Product. We are
		not responsible for the advertising, statements, practices, promises
		or services of manufacturers or sellers of the Products.</p>
	<p>4.2.8.2.Safety: It is your responsibility to exercise discretion
		and observe all safety measures required by law and common sense. We
		assume no responsibility for accidents resulting from or associated
		with the use of the service or your Product. Additional safety
		information and product warnings included with your Product should be
		followed.</p>
	<p>4.2.9. DISPUTES AND MANDATORY ARBITRATION CLAUSE:</p>
	<p>4.2.9.1.IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU READ THIS ARBITRATION CLAUSE.
		IT PROVIDES THAT YOU MAY BE REQUIRED TO SETTLE ANY CLAIM OR DISPUTE
		THROUGH ARBITRATION, EVEN IF YOU WOULD PREFER TO LITIGATE SUCH CLAIMS
		BEFORE A JURY. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT,
		SUCH AS DISCOVERY OR THE RIGHT TO APPEAL THE DECISION, MAY NOT BE
		AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION OR MAY BE MORE LIMITED.</p>
	<p>4.2.9.2.You may opt out of Mandatory Arbitration within the
		first sixty (60) days of receiving a copy of this Contract. Please
		contact our Customer Experience Center if you would like to opt out of
		Mandatory Arbitration. If you do not opt out within sixty (60) days of
		receipt of this Contract, you accept Mandatory Arbitration. If you opt
		out, you will not be required to arbitrate any claims. There is no
		penalty or other negative consequence if you do opt out.</p>
	<p>4.2.9.3.GENERAL ARBITRATION PROVISION: The Federal Arbitration
		Act applies to this Contract. Any dispute, controversy or claim
		between us, regardless of whether based on your subscription, the
		services, the balance on your account, your Product, any prior account
		you had with us, your application, this Contract, any prior agreement
		or any other facts, and regardless of whether the legal theory is
		based on this Contract, another common law theory, a statute or
		another ground (each, a "Claim"), will be settled by neutral
		arbitration before the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"),
		provided, however, that any Claim arising out of or related to the
		EULA will be governed by the provisions of the EULA. Claims within the
		applicable small claims limit in your jurisdiction may be brought in
		small claims court rather than arbitration.</p>
	<p>4.2.9.4.FORUM SELECTION AND APPLICABLE PROCEDURE: Unless you and
		we agree otherwise, the arbitration will take place in the county of
		your billing address (provided such address is in the United States).
		For Claims over $10,000, the AAA's Wireless Industry Arbitration
		("WIA") rules will apply. In large/complex cases under the WIA rules,
		the arbitrators must apply the Federal Rules of Evidence and a party
		may have the award reviewed by a panel of three new arbitrators. For
		Claims of $10,000 or less, the complaining party can choose either the
		AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer‐Related Disputes or
		individual action in small claims court. You can obtain procedures,
		rules and fee information from the AAA (www.ADR.org) or from us. Each
		of us may be required to exchange relevant evidence in advance. For
		claims of</p>
	<p>4.2.9.5.$10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether
		the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents
		submitted to the arbitrator, by telephonic hearing, or by an in‐person
		hearing. To initiate arbitration under this Contract, contact the AAA,
		which will provide the necessary forms for you to submit. In the case
		of a conflict between any arbitration rules and this Contract, this
		Contract governs.</p>
	<p>4.2.9.6.ARBITRATION FEES AND COSTS: In any arbitration between
		us, you will be responsible for paying your share of the arbitration
		fees up to the amount of any filing fees you would have incurred if
		you had brought a claim in the state or federal court closest to your
		billing address, and we will pay the remainder of the fees.</p>
	<p>4.2.9.7.CLASS ACTION WAIVER: YOU AND WE EACH WAIVE THE RIGHT TO
		BRING CLAIMS ON A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS BASIS, EVEN IF AAA OR WIA
		PROCEDURES OR RULES WOULD ALLOW IT. WE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A
		JURY OR COURT TRIAL. The arbitrator may award monetary or injunctive
		relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only
		to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's
		individual Claim. IF THIS CLASS ACTION WAIVER IS DEEMED UNENFORCEABLE,
		THEN THE ENTIRE ARBITRATION PROVISION SHALL BE DEEMED UNENFORCEABLE.
		IN NO CIRCUMSTANCE SHALL CLASS CLAIMS BE BROUGHT OR ADJUDICATED IN
		ARBITRATION.</p>
	<p>4.2.9.8.CLAIM NOTICES: If you or we have a Claim against the
		other, before initiating, joining, or participating in any lawsuit,
		arbitration or other legal proceeding, the complaining party shall
		give the other party: (1) a written notice of the Claim (referred to
		below as a "Claim Notice"), explaining in reasonable detail the nature
		of the Claim and any supporting facts; and (2) a reasonable good faith
		opportunity (not less than 30 days) to resolve the claim without the
		necessity of a legal proceeding. Any Claim Notice directed to Paby
		shall be sent to us at Paby Labs, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 1355
		Market St, 2nd Floor, 94103. Any Claim Notice directed to you shall be
		sent to your address appearing in our records or, if you advise us
		that you are represented by counsel, to your attorney at your
		attorney's office. If you or we fail to comply with this Claim Notices
		provision before commencing a lawsuit, arbitration or other legal
		proceeding, that failure shall be a complete defense to all claims
		asserted in such proceeding.</p>
	<p>4.2.9.9.USE OF ARBITRATION AWARD OR JUDGMENTS IN SUBSEQUENT
		CASES: An arbitration award and any judgment confirming it only
		applies to the arbitration in which it was awarded and can't be used
		in any other case except to enforce the award itself.</p>
	<p>4.2.9.10. CURE PROVISION: You and we intend for both of us to
		have the right to arbitrate disputes on an individual basis as set
		forth above. If a court finds any reason to invalidate or refuse to
		enforce this arbitration provision, the party aggrieved by that
		decision shall have the right to take unilateral action to eliminate
		the basis for the court's decision, such as by waiving any right or
		remedy it has under this Contract or agreeing to additional fee or
		cost shifting. This cure right may be exercised during briefing of a
		motion to compel arbitration, during oral argument, or in a renewed
		motion to compel arbitration. If a renewed motion is filed, you and we
		agree that the exercise of cure rights hereunder shall constitute new
		facts permitting such a renewed motion.</p>
	<p>4.2.10. Disclaimers/Limitation of Liability</p>

		IN ANY SEPARATE LIMITED WARRANTY THAT MAY BE APPLICABLE TO YOUR

		FORBIDS IT IN ANY PARTICULAR CASE, THE LIMITATIONS AND WAIVERS IN THIS
		SECTION WILL APPLY REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER
		STATUTORY, FRAUD, MISREPRESENTATION, BREACH OF CONTRACT, PERSONAL
		INJURY, PRODUCTS LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER THEORY. NEITHER WE NOR YOU

		CONNECTION WITH THIS CONTRACT, THE USE, FAILURE TO USE, OR INABILITY
		TO USE THE PRODUCT OR THE SERVICES, EXCEPT WHERE THE CLAIMS RESULT
		FROM OUR GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT. IF ANOTHER SERVICE
		PROVIDER IS INVOLVED IN ANY PROBLEM (FOR EXAMPLE, BECAUSE OF ROAMING),
		YOU ALSO AGREE TO ANY LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY THAT THE SERVICE
		PROVIDER ALSO IMPOSES. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO
		CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP WHATSOEVER WITH ANY OF OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS
		AND YOU ARE NOT A THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY OF ANY AGREEMENT BETWEEN US
		AND SUCH SERVICE PROVIDERS. UNLESS YOU HAVE A SEPARATE CONTRACT WITH
		OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS, SUCH SERVICE PROVIDERS HAVE NO LEGAL, EQUITABLE
		OR OTHER LIABILITY OF ANY KIND TO YOU AND YOU WAIVE ANY AND ALL CLAIMS
		OR DEMANDS FOR SUCH LIABILITY. OUR MAXIMUM LIABILITY TO YOU UNDER ANY
		THEORY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO FRAUD, MISREPRESENTATION, BREACH
		OF CONTRACT, PERSONAL INJURY, OR PRODUCTS LIABILITY) IS LIMITED TO AN
		AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE PORTION OF THE CHARGES TO YOU FOR THE SERVICES
		RELATING TO THE PERIOD OF SERVICE DURING WHICH SUCH DAMAGES OCCUR.</p>

	<p>4.4.1. Warranties</p>
	<p>4.4.1.1.Paby Inc. ("Paby") Standard One (1) Year Limited Product
		Warranty (the "Limited Product Warranty")</p>
	<p>4.4.1.2.SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
		LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR ALLOW LIMITATIONS
		ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY OR CONDITION MAY LAST, SO THE
		LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS DESCRIBED BELOW MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU TO THE
		EXTENT THEY ARE INCONSISTENT WITH YOUR JURISDICTION'S APPLICABLE LAW.
		THIS LIMITED WARRANTY GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS, AND YOU MAY
		ALSO HAVE OTHER RIGHTS UNDER STATE, FEDERAL OR OTHER APPLICABLE
		JURISDICITONAL LAW.</p>
	<p>4.4.1.3.Paby's warranty obligations for this hardware product
		are limited to the terms set forth below: Paby warrants to the
		original purchaser that your hardware product shall be free from
		material defects in materials and workmanship under normal use for a
		period of one (1) year from the date of purchase ("Warranty Period").
		Whether a defect occurs will be determined solely with reference to
		the product documentation. If a hardware defect arises and a valid
		claim is received by Paby within the Warranty Period, Paby will, in
		its sole and exclusive discretion and to the extent permitted by law,
		either (1) repair (or request that you repair pursuant to the next
		succeeding sentence) the product at no charge, using new parts or
		reconditioned parts equivalent to new in performance and reliability,
		(2) exchange the product with a product that is new or equivalent to
		new in performance and reliability and is at least functionally
		equivalent to the original product, or (3) refund the purchase price
		of the product (but not the purchase price of the Paby service(s)
		included with the product), provided that you return the product to
		Paby as provided below. Paby may request that you replace defective
		parts with new or refurbished user‐installable parts that Paby
		provides in fulfillment of its warranty obligation. A replacement
		product or part, including a user‐installable part that has been
		installed in accordance with instructions provided by Paby, assumes
		the remaining warranty of the original product or ninety (90) days
		from (1) the date of replacement or repair, or (2) in the case of
		user-installable parts, the date that is ten (10) days after the date
		that Paby ships the parts to you), whichever provides longer coverage
		for you. When a product or part is exchanged, any replacement item
		becomes your property and the replaced item becomes Paby' property.
		Parts provided by Paby in fulfillment of its warranty obligation must
		be used in products for which warranty service is claimed. When a
		refund is given, Paby may require that the product for which the
		refund is provided is returned to Paby, at which time it shall become
		Paby' property. Consumers in some jurisdictions may have legal rights
		under applicable national legislation governing the sale of consumer
		goods, including, without limitation, national laws implementing EC
		Directive 99/44. These rights are not affected by the warranties in
		this Limited Product Warranty.</p>
	<p>4.4.1.4.Exclusions and limitations</p>
	<p>4.4.1.4.1.This Limited Product Warranty applies only to the
		hardware product manufactured by or for Paby that can be identified by
