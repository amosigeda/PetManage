		<h3>How does the Paby GPS Pet Tracker attach to my pet's collar?  </h3>
<p>The Paby GPS Pet Tracker can be attached directly onto your pet's existing collar or harness by using the provided black OR white rubber strap.   After the device has been assembled, place the collar flat onto the back of the product.  Then stretch the rubber strap across the product and collar, attaching it to the other side of the device and securing the collar in place.  The device can easily be removed from the collar when it needs to be charged - and don't worry, the app will let you know when it's time do that.
</p>

<h3>How do people get SIM cards?
</h3>
<p>
In the United States, T-Mobile and AT&T providers as these both run on WCDMA 3G and GSM 2G.If in another country, you can purchase a SIM card that is also WCDMA 3G and GSM 2G capable.
</p>

<h3>GPS, LBS and WiFi Scan, which one is best?  Can they be used together or have to be one at a time?</h3>
	<ul class="spot">
		<li>LBS: This refers to the Location Based Services. When a device is outside of the Wifi scan range, LBS will be activated to locate your device through cell towers.</li>
		<li>GPS: If you canont connect to LBS, GPS will activate if connected to a cellular network. It will not turn on without a cellular network, and only during real time tracking should it be turned on. GPS location signals are sent from satellites in orbit. </li>
		<li>Real time tracking: A device can be located using real time tracking. This occurs when the Wi-Fi scan, BS and GPS are all turned on. This allows for a faster and more accurate location discovery.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>What Affects GPS Signal?</h3>
	<ul class="spot">
		<li>The GPS signal and accuracy of your Paby is affected various factors including weather, obstructions and metal objects. Here are a few ways to improve the GPS signal strength and accuracy of your Paby:</li>
		<li>Clear view of the sky (no obstructions from building and trees which could block the signal)</li>
		<li>Prevent interference from metal objects as it will affect the signal strength. This includes using the Paby inside of a car or shed.</li>
		<li>Keep your battery charged for optimal performance. </li>
		<li>When you're not on your Home Wi-Fi network, the Paby will first scan for other familiar Wi-Fi networks for a location before it searches for a GPS signal. However, a GPS is generally more accurate.</li>
	</ul>
	<ul class="spot two">
		<li>Urban areas
			<ul class="circle three">
				<li>There are a number of WiFi points available (from surrounding houses) to help the Paby triangulate a position without GPS.</li>
				<li>Possible limitations on GPS signal strength due to building obstructions</li>
				<li>Cell reception generally strong</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Rural areas
			<ul class="circle three">
				<li>There are a limited number of WiFi points available (given the reduction in property density) to triangulate a position</li>
				<li>Clear and open areas make it beneficial to obtain a strong GPS signal, however is still subject to cloud coverage</li>
				<li>Possible poor cell reception out in rural areas. Please check the coverage in your area.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>What affects cellular reception?</h3>
	<p>In order to make sure your area has coverage, check out the 3G/2G coverage in your area. If you do have coverage, here are a few other factors that may affect the cell signal strength of your Paby:</p>
	<ul class="spot">
		<li>Elevation - deep within a valley means a weaker signal strength</li>
		<li>Interference - manmade or natural obstructions such as buildings or trees can interfere with the signal strength</li>
         <li>Lack of towers (more prominent in rural areas) - with an increase in distance to the tower comes a weaker signal strength</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>How do I check to see if my Home WiFi is set up correctly? </h3>
 <ul class="spot">
   <li>You can easily check to see if your Home WiFi configuration was successful by looking for the indicated WiFi at the top of the APP, located next to the battery symbol. If you see the WiFi bars indicated in green, this means you are connected to your WiFi. 
  </li>
	</ul>
